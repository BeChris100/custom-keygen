# Custom Key Generator
This README file was written pretty quickly because I'm hella lazy. However, this project was more of a personal project that I eventually shared on my Instagram page.

Note that I am not putting any restrictions or protections on this project. Feel free to do anything. Steal the code. Modify the code. Distribute it. No contact needed for any type of permission.

## Purpose
It was more of a experimental project, where I wanted to write a custom Key Generator that relies on a custom Key Validation Algorithm. That means, no harm is intended here.
